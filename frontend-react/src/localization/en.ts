                "The system will allow users to manage the smart meter devices at home. For a user, it will be possible to set different smart meters for the different houses they own/rent, and track the power consumption statistics over time that is collected automatically. They can track the power consumption of different devices in different time of the day (e.g., at night). They can also shut down the power to one of their houses through the system, when power is not needed. The power distribution company can consult the power consumption statistics over period of times of all the users registered into the system.",
